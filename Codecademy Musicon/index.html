This is a header element that goes at the top of the page, with a nested section element.
It contains the h1 heading, and space to build the navbar within the nav tags.
If the section element is acting as a container, I'm not sure why div tags are not being used.

<!--REVISIT
I thought there was only supposed to be one h1 tag per page.
Semantic HTML tags: article and section. If the section tags are only containers,
I believe the div tags should be used instead.
